    <h1>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Machine Learning</h1>

    <ul><li>A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network sketched for processing structured arrays of data such as portrayals.<li>CNN are very satisfactory at picking up on design in the input image, such as lines, gradients, circles, or even eyes and faces.<li>This characteristic that makes convolutional neural network so robust for computer vision.<li>CNN can run directly on a underdone image and do not need any preprocessing.<li>A convolutional neural network is a feed forward neural network, seldom with up to 20.<li>The strength of a convolutional neural network comes from a particular kind of layer called the convolutional layer.<li>CNN contains many convolutional layers assembled on top of each other, each one competent of recognizing more sophisticated shapes.<li>With three or four convolutional layers it is viable to recognize handwritten digits and with 25 layers it is possible to differentiate human faces.<li>The agenda for this sphere is to activate machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a alike fashion and even use the knowledge for a multitude of duty such as image and video recognition, image inspection and classification, media recreation, recommendation systems, natural language processing, etc.</ul><p><b>Convolutional Neural Network Design :</b><ul><li>The construction of a convolutional neural network is a multi-layered feed-forward neural network, made by assembling many unseen layers on top of each other in a particular order.<li>It is the sequential design that give permission to CNN to learn hierarchical attributes.<li>In CNN, some of them followed by grouping layers and hidden layers are typically convolutional layers followed by activation layers.<li>The pre-processing needed in a ConvNet is kindred to that of the related pattern of neurons in the human brain and was motivated by the organization of the Visual Cortex.</ul><p><b>Case Study of CNN for Diabetic retinopathy :</b><ul><li>Diabetic retinopathy also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical state in which destruction occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus, It is a major cause of blindness in advance countries.<li>Diabetic retinopathy influence up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more.<li>The overlong a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of growing diabetic retinopathy.<li>It is also the main cause of blindness in people of age group 20-64.<li>Diabetic retinopathy is the outcome of destruction to the small blood vessels and neurons of the retina.</ul>
