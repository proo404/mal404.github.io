1. Supervised Machine Learning
    </h1>

    <p>
        Supervised learning algorithms are used when the output is classified or labeled. These algorithms learn from the past data that is inputted, called training data, runs its analysis and uses this analysis to predict future events of any new data within the known classifications. The accurate prediction of test data requires large data to have a sufficient understanding of the patterns. The algorithm can be trained further by comparing the training outputs to actual ones and using the errors for modification of the algorithms.

<p><strong>Real-Life Example-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Classification &#8211;</strong> The algorithm is drawn from feeding with labeled image data. An algorithm is trained, and it is expected that the algorithm classifies it correctly in the case of the new image.</li>
<li><strong>Market Prediction &#8211;</strong> It is also called Regression. Historical business market data is fed to the computer. Then, with analysis and regression algorithm, the new price for the future is predicted depending on variables.</li>
</ul>

        2. Unsupervised Machine Learning</h1>

        
        <p>
            Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when we are unaware of the final outputs, and the classification or labeled outputs are not at our disposal. These algorithms study and generate a function to describe completely hidden and unlabelled patterns. Hence, there is no correct output, but it studies the data to give out unknown structures in unlabelled data.


            <p><strong>Real-Life Example-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clustering &#8211;</strong> Data with similar traits are asked to group together by the algorithm; this grouping is called clusters. These prove helpful in the study of these groups, which can be applied to the entire data within a cluster more or less.</li>
<li><strong>High Dimension Data &#8211;</strong> High dimension data is normally not easy to work with. With the help of unsupervised learning, visualization of high dimension data becomes possible.</li>
<li><strong>Generative Models &#8211;</strong> Once your algorithm analyses and comes up with the probability distribution of the input, it can be used to generate new data. This proves to be very helpful in cases of missing data.</li>
</ul>
        </p>

        <h4>3. Reinforcement Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>This type of machine learning algorithm uses the trial and error method to churn out output based on the highest efficiency of the function. The output is compared to find out errors and feedback fed back to the system to improve or maximize its performance. The model is provided with rewards which are basically feedback and punishments in its operations while performing a particular goal.</p>
        
        <h4>4. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>These algorithms normally undertake labeled and unlabeled data, where the unlabelled data amount is large as compared to labeled data. As it works with both and in between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, therefore is called semi-supervised machine learning. Systems using these models are seen to have improved learning accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong> <strong>&#8211;</strong> An image archive can contain only some of its data labeled, e.g. Dog, cat, mouse, and a large chunk of images remain unlabelled.</p>
